> Unit tests are [deterministic tests](glossary#deterministic-test) that exercise a discrete unit of the application, such as a function, method, or UI component, in isolation to determine whether it behaves as expected.
>
> -- [Testing Glossary](glossary#unit-test)

When testing the specs of functions, prefer testing public API (methods, interfaces, functions) to private API: the spec of private functions and methods are meant to change easily in the future, and unit-testing them would amount to writing a Change Detector Test, which is an anti-pattern.

The purpose of unit tests are to:

- Verify the functionality of a unit (method, class, function, etc.) in isolation
- Good for testing hi-complexity logic where there may be many permutations (e.g. business logic)
- Keep Cyclomatic Complexity low through good separations of concerns and architecture

### Principles

- Unit tests are low-level and focus on discrete units of the application
- All dependencies are typically replaced with test-doubles to remove non-determinism
- Unit tests are fast to execute
- Test Suite is ran after every code change

## Recommended Best Practices

- Run a subset of your test suite based on the part of the code your are currently working on
  - Following TDD practices plus the watch functionality of certain testing frameworks is an easy way to achieve this
- Pre-commit hooks to run the test suite before committing code to version control
  - Verification during PR and during the CI build on the HEAD to verify that earlier verification happened and was effective.
- Discourage disabling of static tests (e.g. skipping tests, ignoring warnings, ignoring code on coverage evaluation, etc)
- Write custom rules (lint, formatting, etc) for common code review feedback
