Work in Progress (WIP) is the total work that has been started but not
completed. This includes **all** work, defects, tasks, stories, etc.

## What is the intended behavior?

Focus the team on finishing work and delivering it rather than switching between tasks but not finishing them.

## How to improve it

- The team should focus on finishing items closest to being ready for
  production.
  - Prioritize code review over starting new work
  - Prioritize pairing to solve a problem over starting new work
- Set and do not exceed WIP limits for the team.
  - Total WIP should not exceed team size.
- Keep the Kanban board visible at all times to monitor WIP

## How to game it

- Update incomplete work to "done" before it is delivered to production.
- Create stories for each step of development instead of for value to be delivered.
- Do not update work to "in progress" when working on it.
