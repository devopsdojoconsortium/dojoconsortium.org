Workflow management is the process the team uses to move things from "In Progress" to "Done", as rapidly as possible in value sequence. It's important for minimizing WIP that the team looks at the backlog as the team's work and does not pre-assign work to individuals.

## Workflow Management Process

In order to streamline business tasks, minimize room for error, and increase
overall efficiency, teams need to have the following prerequisites.

- [Definition of Done](../definition-of-done)
- [Kanban Board](../visualizing-workflow), virtual or physical, with a
  prioritized backlog

---

### Plan Work

Unplanned work is _anything_ coming into the backlog that has not been committed
to, or prioritized. This can include feature requests, support tickets, etc.

Common struggles teams face with unplanned work can be:

- [Work that has not been prioritized](../unplanned-work)
- [Work that has not been decomposed](../../work-decomposition/work-breakdown)
- [Work that is unplanned](../unplanned-work)

---

### Do Work

Completed work meets the [Definition of Ready](../../work-decomposition/definition-of-ready)
when work begins, the [Definition of Done](../definition-of-done) when work
is delivered, and can be completed in less than two days.

Process smells identified for completing work include:

- [Context switching](../team-dynamics)
- [Ineffective demos, or lack thereof](../feedback-loops)
- [Multiple teams owning pieces of the process](../team-dynamics)
- [Status and visibility of work is unclear](../visualizing-workflow)
- [Siloed work](../team-dynamics)

---

### Improve Work

In order to plan and complete work effectively, there must be [an improvement
process](../delivery-system-improvement-journey#3-continuous-improvement) in place. The improvement process is centered around feedback loops.

Challenges associated with the improvement process:

- [Infrequent or nonexistent demos](../feedback-loops)
- [Infrequent and unactionable retrospectives](../../retrospective-playbook)

### Measuring Your Workflow

A good measure to implement in your team's workflow is [WIP](../limiting-wip).
Limiting work in progress can help reduce constraints in your workflow.

[Development cycle time](/metrics/development-cycle-time) is a key
measure of success when trying to optimize and automate your team's workflow.
