## Recommended Practices

- Small changes allow for faster code review and enhance the feedback loops.
- Everyone on the team is capable of performing code review.
- Code reviews are the second highest priority for a team behind blocked issues and
  ahead of [WIP](/docs/metrics/work-in-progress).

## Tips

- Automate coding standards instead of reviewing for them.
- Focus the review on the tests and code readability. The tests should meet the acceptance criteria agreed upon by
  the team.
- Keep pull requests small. Look into [Work Decomposition](/docs/work-decomposition/work-breakdown)
  for guidance.
- Use synchronous code review to remove communication delays.
- As the person being reviewed, remember the 10 Commandments of Code Review
  - Thou shalt not take it personally
  - Thou shalt not marry thy code
  - Thou shalt consider all feedback
  - Thou shalt articulate thy rationale
  - Thou shalt be willing to compromise
  - Thou shalt contribute to others’ code reviews
  - Thou shalt treat submitters how thou would like to be treated
  - Thou shalt not be intimidated by the number of comments
  - Thou shalt not repeat the same mistakes
  - Thou shalt embrace the nits
