All organisations need a Definition of Done, and every team should define what Done means for the things they deliver within the context of the organisationâ€™s Definition. The Definition of Done is a shared agreement that no unit of work is complete until it meets all agreed conditions.

## Recommended Practices

While the Definition of Done applies to the entire product, you can test it against individual backlog items such as user stories. The whole team, including the Product Owner, must agree that each item meets all criteria before it is considered done.

Each organisation should create a core Definition of Done that reflects what it values, but it must include at least these criteria:

* Deployed to at least a subset of real users
* Collecting telemetry to validate the original hypothesis

Each product, and subsequently each team, should define its own criteria within those organisational boundaries. At a minimum, include the following:

* All tests passed
* Code reviewed by a team member and merged to trunk
* Demoed to the team or stakeholders in a production-like environment
* All code associated with the work deployed to production

Once you have agreed on your Definition of Done, hold yourselves accountable to it for every unit of work.

## Value

As a development team, we want to understand our team's definition of done, so
that we can ensure a unit of work is meeting the criteria acceptable for it to
be delivered to our customers.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Identify what your team cares about as a Definition of Done.
- Use your Definition of Done as a tool to ensure quality items are being
  released into production.
- Revisit and evaluate your Definition of Done.
