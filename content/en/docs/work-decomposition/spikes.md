  Time-boxed explorations (1-3 days) for work items with high uncertainty that cannot be estimated, used sparingly to reduce risk

Spikes are an exploration of potential solutions for work or research items that cannot be estimated. They
should be time-boxed in short increments (1-3 days).

## Recommended Practices

Since all work has some amount of uncertainty and risk, spikes should be used
infrequently when the team has no idea on how to proceed with a work item. They
should result in information that can be used to better refine work into something
valuable, for some iteration in the future.

Spikes should follow a [Definition of Done](/docs/workflow-management/definition-of-done),
with acceptance criteria, that can be demoed at the end of its timebox.

A spike should have a definite timebox with frequent feedback to the team on what's been learned so far. It can be
tempting to learn everything about the problem and all of the solutions before trying anything, but the best way to
learn is to learn using the problem in front of us right now. Batching learning is worse than batching other kinds of
work because effective learning requires applying the learning immediately or it's lost.

### Tips

- Use spikes sparingly, only when high uncertainty exists.
- Spikes should be focused on discovery and experimentation.
- Stay within the parameters of the spike. Anything else is considered a waste.
