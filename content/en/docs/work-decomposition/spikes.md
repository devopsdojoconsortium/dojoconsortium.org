Spikes are an exploration of potential solutions for work or research items that cannot be estimated. They
should be time-boxed in short increments (2-3 days).

## Recommended Practices

Since all work has some amount of uncertainty and risk, spikes should be used
infrequently when the team has no idea on how to proceed with a work item. They
should result in information that can be used to better refine work into something
valuable, for some iteration in the future.

Spikes should follow a [Definition of Done](/docs/workflow-management/definition-of-done),
with acceptance criteria, that can be demoed at the end of its timebox.

A spike should have a definite timebox, usually within 1-3 days. At the end of
this timebox, the team should be able to decide how, when, and even if the work
can be considered for upcoming iterations.

### Tips

- Use spikes sparingly, only when high uncertainty exists.
- Spikes should be focused on discovery and experimentation.
- Stay within the parameters of the spike. Anything else is considered a waste.
