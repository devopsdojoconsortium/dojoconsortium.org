## Product Goals

Product goals are a way to turn your vision for your product into easy to
understand objectives that can be measured and achieved in a certain amount of time.

```gherkin
Increased transparency into product metrics

Measurable Outcome: Increased traffic to product page
```

When generating product goals, you need to understand what problem you are
solving, who you are solving it for, and how you measure that you achieved the goals.

## Initiatives

Product goals can be broken down into initiatives, that when accomplished,
deliver against the product strategy.

```gherkin
Provide one view for all product KPIs.
```

```gherkin
Ensure products have appropriate metrics associated with them.
```

Initiatives can then be broken down into epics, stories, tasks, etc. among
product teams, with high-level requirements associated.

## Epics

An epic is a complete business feature with outcomes defined **before**
stories are written. Epics should never be open ended buckets of work.

```gherkin
I want to be able to review the CI metrics trends of teams who have completed a
DevOps Dojo engagement.
```

### Tips

- Product goals need a description and key results needed to achieve
  them.
- Initiatives need enough information to help the team understand the expected
  value, the requirements, measure of success, and the time frame associated to completion.
