These are the core skills we recommend everyone learn to execute CD.

## Behavior-Driven Development

Every step in CD requires clear, testable acceptance criteria as a prerequisite. BDD is not test automation. BDD is the
discussion that informs acceptance test driven development.

## Continuous-Integration

Continuous integration is a requirement for CD. It requires very frequent integration of non-breaking code.

## Conway's law

"Any organization that designs a system will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the
organization's communication structure." - Melvin Conway

Loosely coupled teams create loosely coupled systems. The opposite is also true.

## Domain-Driven Design

This is another key design tool both for organizational and system design. This is a critical skill for developing microservices.

## Pipeline Steps

Architecting a system of delivery is about designing efficient quality gates for the system's context.

## Test-Driven Development (Design)

TDD highly correlates with application architecture that is easy to maintain and easy to upgrade.

## Three Ways

The core principles that define DevOps:

1. Consider the system of delivery as a whole
2. Amplify feedback loops
3. Continuously learn and improve the delivery system

## Value Stream Mapping

The primary process analysis tool used to help identify and attack constraints to delivery.

## Wastes

Our goal is to remove waste daily. We must first learn to recognize it.
