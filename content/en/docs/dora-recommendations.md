## Continuous Delivery Capabilities

### Use version control for all production artifacts

Version control is the use of a version control system, such as GitHub or Subversion, for all production artifacts,
including application code, application configurations, system configurations, and scripts for automating build and
configuration of the environment.

### Automate your deployment process

Deployment automation is the degree to which deployments are fully automated and do not require manual intervention.

### Implement continuous integration

[Continuous integration](/en/docs/glossary/#continuous-integration) (CI) is the **first step** towards continuous delivery.
This is a development practice where code is regularly
checked in, and each check-in triggers a set of quick tests to discover serious regressions, which developers fix immediately. The
CI process creates canonical builds and packages that are ultimately deployed and released.

### Use trunk-based development methods

Trunk-based development has been shown to be a predictor of high performance in software development and delivery. It is
characterized by fewer than three active branches in a code repository; branches and forks having very short lifetimes
(e.g., less than a day) before being merged into trunk; and application teams rarely or never having code lock periods
when no one can check in code or do pull requests due to merging conflicts, code freezes, or stabilization phases.

### Implement test automation

Test automation is a practice where software tests are run automatically (not manually) continuously throughout the
development process. Effective test suites are reliable—that is, tests find real failures and only pass releasable code.
Note that developers should be primarily responsible for creation and maintenance of automated test suites.

### Support test data management

Test data requires careful maintenance, and test data management is becoming an increasingly important part of automated
testing. Effective practices include having adequate data to run your test suite, the ability to acquire necessary data
on demand, the ability to condition your test data in your pipeline, and the data not limiting the amount of tests you
can run. We do caution, however, that teams should minimize, whenever possible, the amount of test data needed to run
automated tests.

### Shift left on security

Integrating security into the design and testing phases of the software development process is key to driving IT
performance. This includes conducting security reviews of applications, including the Infosec team in the design and
demo process for applications, using pre-approved security libraries and packages, and testing security features as a
part of the automated testing suite.

### Implement continuous delivery (CD)

CD is a development practice where software is in a deployable state throughout its lifecycle, and the team prioritizes keeping the
software in a deployable state over working on new features. Fast feedback on the quality and deployability of the system is
available to all team members, and when they get reports that the system isn't deployable, fixes are made quickly.
Finally, the system can be deployed to production or end users at any time, on demand.

## Architecture Capabilities

### Use a loosely coupled architecture

This affects the extent to which a team can test and deploy their applications on demand, without requiring orchestration with other
services. Having a loosely coupled architecture allows your teams to work independently, without relying on other teams for support
and services, which in turn enables them to work quickly and deliver value to the organization.

### Architect for empowered teams

Our research shows that teams that can choose which tools to use do better at continuous delivery and, in turn, drive
better software development and delivery performance. No one knows better than practitioners what they need to be
effective.

## Product and Process Capabilities

### Gather and implement customer feedback

Our research has found that whether organizations actively and regularly seek customer feedback and incorporate this
feedback into the design of their products is important to software delivery performance.

### Make the flow of work visible through the value stream

Teams should have a good understanding of and visibility into the flow of work from the business all the way through to
customers, including the status of products and features. Our research has found this has a positive impact on IT
performance.

### Work in small batches

Teams should slice work into small pieces that can be completed in a week or less. The key is to have work decomposed
into small features that allow for rapid development, instead of developing complex features on branches and releasing
them infrequently. This idea can be applied at the feature and the product level. (An MVP is a prototype of a product
with just enough features to enable validated learning about the product and its business model.) Working in small
batches enables short lead times and faster feedback loops.

### Foster and enable team experimentation

Team experimentation is the ability of developers to try out new ideas and create and update specifications during the
development process, without requiring approval from outside of the team, which allows them to innovate quickly and
create value. This is particularly impactful when combined with working in small batches, incorporating customer
feedback, and making the flow of work visible.

## Lean Management and Monitoring Capabilities

### Have a lightweight change approval process

Our research shows that a lightweight change approval process based on peer review (pair programming or intra-team code
review) produces superior IT performance than using external change approval boards (CABs).

### Monitor across application and infrastructure to inform business decisions

Use data from application and infrastructure monitoring tools to take action and make business decisions. This goes
beyond paging people when things go wrong.

### Check system health proactively

Monitor system health, using threshold and rate-of-change warnings, to enable teams to preemptively detect and mitigate problems.

### Improve processes and manage work with work-in-progress (WIP) limits

The use of work-in-progress limits to manage the flow of work is well known in the Lean community. When used
effectively, this drives process improvement, increases throughput, and makes constraints visible in the system.

### Visualize work to monitor quality and communicate throughout the team

Visual displays, such as dashboards or internal websites, used to monitor quality and work in progress have been shown
to contribute to software delivery performance.

## Cultural Capabilities

### Support a generative culture (as outlined by Westrum)

This measure of organizational culture is based on a typology developed by Ron Westrum, a sociologist who studied
safety-critical complex systems in the domains of aviation and healthcare. Our research has found that this measure of
culture is predictive of IT performance, organizational performance, and decreasing burnout. Hallmarks of this measure
include good information flow, high cooperation and trust, bridging between teams, and conscious inquiry.

### Encourage and support learning

Is learning, in your culture, considered essential for continued progress? Is learning thought of as a cost or an
investment? This is a measure of an organization’s learning culture.

### Support and facilitate collaboration among teams

This reflects how well teams, which have traditionally been siloed, interact in development, operations, and information security.

### Provide resources and tools that make work meaningful

This particular measure of job satisfaction is about doing work that is challenging and meaningful, and being empowered
to exercise your skills and judgment. It is also about being given the tools and resources needed to do your job well.

### Support or embody transformational leadership

Transformational leadership supports and amplifies the technical and process work that is so essential in DevOps. It is
comprised of five factors: vision, intellectual stimulation, inspirational communication, supportive leadership, and
personal recognition.
