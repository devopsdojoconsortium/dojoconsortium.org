title: Improvement Kata
---

The purpose of the improvement kata is to act as an exercise in order to
overcome obstacles to your team's improvement goals.

## Recommended Exercise

1. Understand the direction
   - What challenge are we striving to meet?
2. Grasp your current condition
   - What is the current way of operating?
3. Establish your next target condition
   - What way of operating do we want to have next?
4. Experiment Toward the Target Condition
   - A step-by-step discovery process between where we are and where we want to be next.

## Phases

1. Planning phase
   - Exercise steps 1, 2, and 3
2. Executing phase
   - Exercise step 4

## Run the PDCA cycle

1. Plan
   - Recognize an opportunity and plan a change.
2. Do
   - Test the change. Carry out a small-scale study.
3. Check
   - Review the test, analyze the results and identify what you've learned.
4. Act
   - Take action based on what you learned in the study step: If the change did not work, go through the cycle again with a different plan. If you were successful, incorporate what you learned from the test into wider changes. Use what you learned to plan new improvements, beginning the cycle again.

## Tips

Use the <a href="../../assets/pdf/A3 Improvement Plan Template.docx" download>A3 Template</a> to clearly define the experiment

Use this in conjunction with the [improvement cadence](./improvement-cadence.html), so that your team may have
every opportunity to improve their processes.

## Value

As a development team, we want to exercise the improvement kata, so that we may
understand and implement the improvement goals of our team.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Understand your current and target conditions as the most important constraint your team is facing.
- Commit to taking the steps necessary to reach your target condition.
- Re-evaluate and revisit every cadence.
