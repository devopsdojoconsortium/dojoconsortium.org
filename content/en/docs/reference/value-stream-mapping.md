The Value Stream Mapping Workshop uncovers all steps from idea conception to production, aiming to identify removable steps, bottlenecks, and high-defect areas.

## Overview

Value Stream Mapping helps teams:

- Identify and remove unnecessary steps
- Uncover waiting periods between steps
- Highlight steps with high defect rates

The outcome guides the design of an improved value stream, prioritizing changes to reduce waste in the current flow.

## Prerequisites

1. An established process for value delivery (for a "to be" value stream)
2. Participation from all stakeholders in the value stream
3. Understanding of key terms:
   - Wait time/non-value time
   - Process time/value add time
   - Percent Complete/Accurate (%C/A)

## Recommended Practices

Start mapping from delivery and move backward to ensure no steps are missed.

## Process

### 1. Identify the Source

Team Demo
{{% /alert %}}

For each source of _Requests_, determine:

- Average process time
- Involved stakeholders
- Percentage of work rejected by the next step

### 2. Identify Rework Loops

Rework loops are interruptions where steps need correction.

### 3. Identify Wait Time

Calculate wait time between steps, considering your team's cadence.

## Outcomes

- Process time/wait time of your flow
- Visual representation of the value stream(s)
- Potential constraints (represented as kaizen bursts)

## Tips

- Regularly review and update the value stream map
- Consider all potential flows for team processes

## Value Proposition

Understanding how to value stream map team processes helps identify delivery constraints and improvement opportunities.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Value stream all processes associated with delivering value
- Create actionable improvement items from the exercise
