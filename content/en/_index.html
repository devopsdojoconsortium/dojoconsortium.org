The Dojo Consortium was formed in 2018 by practitioners from several Fortune 100 Dojos. Dojos use immersive learning techniques to help teams improve their delivery outcomes in their context. This site is the knowledge base for things we have found effective for helping teams deliver sooner, safer, and happier while providing better outcomes for the organizations and the end-users.
