## How to contribute

This is site is built using Hugo, a Golang based static site generator. The [Hugo Getting Started](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/) guide shows how to install Hugo locally for content development.

To add content:

1. Fork the repository
2. Make your changes and send a pull request (PR).
3. If you're not yet ready for a review, add "WIP" to the PR name to indicate 
  it's a work in progress. 
4. Continue updating your doc and pushing your changes until you're happy with 
  the content.
5. When you're ready for a review, add a comment to the PR, and remove any
  "WIP" markers.

To check out the changes as you make them and verify content run `npm start` and navigate to [localhost:1313](http://localhost:1313/). This will serve the site and watch for changes.
