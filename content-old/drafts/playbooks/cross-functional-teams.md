title: Cross Functional Teams
---

Cross functional teams contain all of the capabilities to build, test, deploy,
and operate their components without requiring handoffs. Every product team
needs the cross functional abilities to support their components from birth to
death.

## Recommended Practices

- Implement good practices for [managing workflow](./workflow-management/index.html) and
  [estimating](./work-decomposition/complexity-workbreakdown.html) work. Have an [improvement
  process](./improvement-cadence.html) in place, and stick to it.
  - Constantly evaluate and reevaluate your priorities and processes. Measure
    your progress and success, and adjust accordingly.
- Understand role expectations.
  - If the product owner role does not exist, the team should help carry the
    burden of product owner. The team should have knowledge of the business,
    understand the basis for prioritizing work, and use their business technical
    knowledge to challenge requirements if misguided.
  - The role of the scrum trunk or agile coach in a cross functional team comes
    with the ability to not only understand the good practices associated to the
    process, but the ability to execute the improvement process.
- Practice paired programming in order to actively share knowledge across team members.

## Tips

- Understand your consumers, and focus on delivering value to them.
- All team members should perform all aspects to some level of competency.
  Prevent knowledge silos that put development or recovery time at risk.
- Avoid flexing resources between teams. Consider
  [innersourcing](./tech-tips/innersource.html) if a team needs extra help.

## Value

As a team, we want to have a cross functional team, so that we can build and support our product without handing off work to other teams and improve team resiliency in the face of uncertainty.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Assemble all of the skills needed to plan, design, build, and support our product onto one team.

- Clearly define goals and objectives.

- Have a leader to hold the team accountable and help create leaders within the
  team.
