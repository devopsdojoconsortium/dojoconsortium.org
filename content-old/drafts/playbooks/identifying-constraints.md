title: Identifying Constraints
---

Applying the Theory of Constraints is a way to identify the most important
limiting factor that stands in the way of achieving a goal, and then
systematically improving that constraint until it is no longer the limiting factor.

Once you've identified the bottlenecks holding you back, the next step is to
find the solution. It is imperative that you revisit and evaluate the solution
put in place to manage said constraint.

## Recommended Practices

1. Improvement Kata

   The [Improvement Kata](./../playbooks/improvement-kata.html) is a repeating pattern
   by which a team can adapt and innovate towards their goal of continuous
   improvement. Understand the challenge at hand, current condition, and
   target condition. Determine the next steps to reach said target condition.

2. Awesome Board

   The awesome board is a variation of the improvement kata, that defines what
   awesome for a team should look like, and the next steps to reach that goal.

3. Lead Time

   The lead time shows the average time it takes for a new request to be
   delivered. This is measured from the creation date to release date for each
   unit of work and includes [Development Cycle Time](../metrics/development-cycle-time.html).

4. Cycle Time

   The cycle time shows the time from code commit to production deploy. This is
   the minimum time changes can be applied to production.

## Tips

1. [Value Stream Mapping](./vsm.html) is a great
   resource to use to identify your team's constraints within your workflow.

2. Retrospectives are another way to discuss constraints the team is facing.
   **Note: Make sure the constraints that are discussed have action items created**
   **on the backlog.**

## Value

As a development team, we want to identify our constraints, so that we may take
action to mitigate our bottlenecks and continuously improve our workflow.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Identify your biggest constraint.
- Take steps to mitigate.
- Revisit and evaluate your solution.
