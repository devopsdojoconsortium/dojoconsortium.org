title: Improvement Cadence
---

The purpose of this playbook is to give example of an improvement cadence that
development teams may implement in an effort to become more cross-functional and
begin the journey of improvement.

## Recommended Practices

### Daily Standup

#### 1. Go over the board (10 min)

- Does the board resemble the current state of all work in flight?
- Is there anything being worked that is not represented on the board?
- Is anything blocked from progressing?

#### 2. Coaching Kata Session (5 min)

1. What is the current condition? _(Known)_
2. What is the target condition? _(Known)_
3. What obstacles are keeping us from reaching the target condition? _(Which one are we working against now?)_
   - What did we plan as your last step?
   - What did we expect?
   - What actually happened?
   - What did we learn?
     1. What is our next step? _(What do we expect?)_
     2. How quickly can we go and see what we have learned from taking that step?

### Backlog Refinement (Once per cadence x 30min)

1. Take highest priority card
   - Good Practice: pull from top
2. Identify scenarios
   - Behavior Driven Development
3. Split stories
   - Meets [INVEST](../glossary.html#invest)
   - [Vertically Sliced](../glossary.html#vertical-sliced-story)
   - [Acceptance Criteria](#acceptance-criteria)
4. Refine in the now
   - Only worry about refining work that can be picked up for the next 2.5 days

### Demo/Retrospective (Time-box 30 min)

1. If nothing to demo, we retro as to why.
2. Reflect as to whether the target condition is still the target condition

- Utilize [improvement kata](./improvement-kata.html), awesome board, etc.
- Have actionable items and _implement_ those items

## Tips

- Consider backlog refinement, demo/retro every two days. Only refine enough to
  last until the next refinement session.

- Use the improvement cadence strictly, until the team feels there is a reason
  to make changes or improvements based on team dynamic.

- Use daily standup and retrospective to go over and reflect on team metric health.

## Value

As a development team, we want to understand and implement the improvement
cadence, so that we may have improve our team processes.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Commit to daily standup everyday.
- Have backlog refinement and demo/retro twice a week.
- Create action items and commit to improving them.
