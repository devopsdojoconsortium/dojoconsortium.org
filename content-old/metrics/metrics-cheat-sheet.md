## Organizational Metrics

These metrics are important for teams and management to track the health of the delivery system

| Metric                                                      | Source        | Meaning                                                                      | Goal of Measuring                                                                                                                                            | Guardrail Metrics                               |

## Team Metrics

These metrics should only be used by teams to inform decision making. They are ineffective for measuring quality, productivity, or
delivery system health.

| Metric                                 | Source | Meaning                                                                                                                                                         | Goal of Measuring                                                                     | Issues with Metric                                                                                |

Find code that should be better tested | When coverage goals are set, can generate tests that meet the goals but are ineffective as tests. |
| [Velocity/Throughput](./velocity.html) | Jira   | The average amount of the backlog delivered during a sprint by the team. Used by the product team for planning. There is no such thing as good or bad velocity. |
